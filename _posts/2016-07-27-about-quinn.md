  Quinn grew up immersed in the hair and beauty industry with a mother
  hairstylist and, naturally, graduated first of class in 2004 from The TONI&GUY
  Hairdressing Academy, Dallas, Texas. Subsequently, she assisted TONI&GUY Art
  Team world wide in order to validate and enhance her original training.Without
  a doubt, Quinn continues to adhere to the TONI&GUY philosophy to make each
  client feel good and look good. That is why her education is never
  compromised. Her standard of quality is achieved with on-going training and
  product knowledge classes, consistently updating her skills with the latest
  trends and techniques. Today, Quinn has already pursued L’oreal advanced color
  technique courses, Schwartzkopf color placement classes, Grund razor cut
  techniques and Redken master colorist courses. Most recently, Quinn also
  sharpened her skills acquiring a Curl Deva hair cutting and coloring
  certification in New York. This sets her as one of a handful of certified
  stylists in the North Bay area to specialize in curly hair cutting and
  coloring. However, certified with Coppola’s Keratin Complex Smoothing, Quinn
  can rid your hair of frizz and curls while adding shine health.
