# About Quinn

Hey, curly girl! I am so excited that you have found your way here! A  
little about me.... I have been a hairstylist for the last 12 years. I grew up  
in the salon business, and my mom is a hairstylist; my grandmother was a hairstylist and my great-grandfather was a barber. You could say it's in  
my blood. I am very proud to be continuing the tradition of service. I  
believe that hairstylists have the greatest influence in the world.  
Seriously, who do you trust your most guarded secrets to? Your stylist. I  
promise to never break that confidence. I am more than just your  
service provider; I am your confidant, you coach, and your biggest fan. I  
believe that the time we spend together can be more impactful than just  
making your hair amazing. It can be a time of connection, envisioning,  
and a blissful retreat in the hustle of your week.

I choose to work exclusively with curly haired clients. I freaking love  
them!!! I think with curls comes sass, confidence, sexiness, and some  
fire! I want to spend every moment behind my chair with people who  
inspire me, with work that inspires me. That's why I choose the curly  
girls(and men), the ones who most stylists are terrified of, the ones who  
other want to change. I embrace you, just the way you are. Your crazy  
curl, your frizzy halo, and stubborn cowlicks inspire me to be my best  
self every day, to continually educate myself, study, learn, hone my  
skills, be open to new ideas and ways of thinking. I believe that healthy  
curls are the most beautiful reflection of you. I work with products and a cutting system that values healthy hair, by moisturizing from the inside out. My system reduces frizz, increases moisture, and defines your curls. I will sculpt a shape curl by curl to create the most flattering style for your lifestyle, face shape and maintenance desires.
